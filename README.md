# Password Generator

A simple, web-based password generator that creates secure, random passwords to improve online security. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to generate strong, unique passwords with a single click.

## Features

- **Random Password Generation**: Generates complex passwords containing uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Customizable Length**: Allows users to specify the password length using an input field, supporting lengths between 4 and 128 characters.
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, user-friendly interface that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Clickable Copy-to-Clipboard**: Enables users to click on a generated password to copy it to their clipboard, with a small "Copied!" message for confirmation.
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive design elements that improve user experience through smooth hover animations.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures the password length is within a valid range and provides feedback for invalid inputs.


## Future Enhancements

- Add an option to include/exclude specific character types (e.g., symbols, numbers).
- Allow users to save generated passwords to local storage for later use.
- Add a dark mode toggle for better accessibility.
